The battery is the heart of your child's GoBike, providing the power for countless hours of fun. With a little care and attention, you can ensure it delivers reliable performance and has a long, healthy life. Here are our top 5 tips for maintaining your kids' e-bike battery.

### 1. Avoid Extreme Temperatures

Batteries don't like extreme heat or cold. Never leave the battery or the entire bike sitting in direct sunlight on a hot day or in a freezing car overnight. Store the battery indoors in a cool, dry place when not in use. This is especially important in the harsh Australian climate.

### 2. Don't Drain it Completely

Lithium-ion batteries, like the ones in GoBikes, are happiest when they have some charge. It's best to recharge the battery before it's completely empty. If you see the charge indicator getting low, it's time to head back for a recharge.

### 3. Charge It Smartly

*   **Use the Right Charger:** Always use the charger that came with your GoBike. Using an incompatible charger can be dangerous and damage the battery.
*   **Don't Overcharge:** While our chargers have built-in protection, it's good practice to unplug the battery once it's fully charged. Don't leave it plugged in for days on end.
*   **Charge After Riding:** Get into the habit of charging the battery after each long ride so it's always ready for the next adventure.

### 4. Keep It Clean and Dry

Ensure the battery and its connection points on the bike are always clean and dry. Use a soft, dry cloth to wipe away any dust or moisture. Never use a high-pressure hose to clean the battery area.

### 5. Long-Term Storage

If you're planning to store the bike for a long period (e.g., over winter), it's best to store the battery with about a 40-60% charge. A fully charged or fully depleted battery can degrade faster during long-term storage. Check the charge level every couple of months and top it up if needed.

By following these simple steps, you can maximize the performance and lifespan of your GoBike's battery, ensuring the fun never has to stop!
