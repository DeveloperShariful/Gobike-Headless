Grab your helmets, charge up those e-bikes, and get ready for an adventure at one of our top 3 kid-friendly biking spots!

### 1. Centennial Parklands, Sydney

**Best for:** Beginners and all-round family fun.

Centennial Park is an oasis in the heart of Sydney. Its Grand Drive is a 3.8km loop of flat, smooth tarmac, making it incredibly safe and perfect for little riders just gaining their confidence. With dedicated cycle lanes, beautiful gardens, ponds, and plenty of spots for a picnic, itâ€™s a full day of family fun waiting to happen. The park also has several cafes for that well-deserved post-ride treat!

### 2. The Fernleigh Track, Newcastle/Lake Macquarie

**Best for:** A longer ride and a touch of history.

Stretching 15km between Adamstown and Belmont, the Fernleigh Track is a spectacular paved path built along a former railway line. It winds through stunning forests, wetlands, and historic railway tunnels, offering a unique and exciting experience. The track is mostly flat with some gentle slopes, making it manageable for kids on their GoBikes. You don't have to do the full 30km return trip; simply pick a section and explore at your own pace.

### 3. The Bay Run, Sydney

**Best for:** Scenic views and a vibrant atmosphere.

This iconic 7km loop around Iron Cove Bay is a favourite for a reason. It's almost entirely flat and car-free, offering breathtaking water views the entire way. The path is shared with walkers and joggers, so it's a great place to teach kids about trail etiquette. With numerous parks, playgrounds, and cafes dotted along the route, The Bay Run is the perfect destination for a fun and active family morning.

So what are you waiting for? Get out there and start creating those unforgettable family memories on two wheels!
