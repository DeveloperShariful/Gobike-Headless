Your child's GoBike is built tough, but like any vehicle, a little regular TLC will ensure it stays safe, reliable, and ready for adventure. Teaching your kids these simple checks is also a fantastic way to introduce them to the basics of responsibility and mechanics.

Before each ride, take a minute to run through this quick "ABC-Q" check.

### A is for Air

Properly inflated tyres are key to a smooth and safe ride.
- **Check the Pressure:** Give the tyres a firm squeeze. They should feel solid, not squishy. If they feel soft, use a bike pump to top them up to the recommended PSI (you'll find this written on the side of the tyre).
- **Inspect for Damage:** Quickly scan the tyres for any sharp objects like thorns or glass that might be stuck in the rubber.

### B is for Brakes

This is one of the most important safety checks.
- **Squeeze the Levers:** Squeeze both brake levers. They should feel firm and stop short of touching the handlebar. If they feel spongy or pull all the way back, the brakes need adjusting.
- **Visual Inspection:** Roll the bike forward and apply the brakes. The brake pads should clamp down firmly on the disc rotors and stop the wheel from turning.

### C is for Chain (and Motor)

A happy chain means a happy ride.
- **Look and Listen:** The chain should look clean and lightly oiled, not rusty or caked in dirt. As you spin the wheel, it should move smoothly without making loud clunking noises.
- **Keep it Clean:** If the chain is dirty, use a rag to wipe it down and apply a little bit of bike-specific chain lubricant.

### Q is for Quick Release & Bolts

Check that everything is tight and secure.
- **Give it a Wiggle:** Gently try to wiggle the handlebars, seat, and wheels. Nothing should feel loose or wobbly.
- **Check Axle Bolts:** Make sure the bolts holding the wheels in place are snug and tight.

### And Don't Forget the Battery!

- **Charge it Up:** Before a big ride, make sure the battery is fully charged. Store the battery indoors in a cool, dry place when not in use.

Spending just a couple of minutes on these checks before a ride will give you peace of mind and keep your child's GoBike in top-notch condition. Happy riding!
