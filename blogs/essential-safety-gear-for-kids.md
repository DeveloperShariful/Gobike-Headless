At GoBike, we build our e-bikes to be as safe as possible, but the adventure doesn't start until your child is properly geared up. The right safety equipment is non-negotiable; it's the key to building confidence and protecting your little rider from bumps and scrapes along the way.

Hereâ€™s our guide to the essential safety gear every young GoBike champion should have.

### 1. The Helmet: Protect Their Most Important Asset

This is the number one, must-have piece of equipment. A well-fitting helmet can reduce the risk of head injury by up to 85%.

*   **Find the Right Fit:** A helmet should sit level on your child's head and be snug but not tight. Use the "two-finger" rule: there should be about two fingers' width between their eyebrows and the helmet.
*   **Check the Straps:** The side straps should form a 'V' shape just under their ears, and the chin strap should be snug enough that you can only fit one finger between it and their chin.
*   **Look for Australian Standards:** Ensure any helmet you buy meets the mandatory Australian safety standards (look for the AS/NZS 2063 sticker).

### 2. Knee and Elbow Pads: For Those Inevitable Tumbles

Scraped knees and elbows are a rite of passage for any new rider. A good set of pads can turn a tearful tumble into a minor "oops!" that they can just shake off. Look for pads that are cushioned, have a hard outer shell, and can be securely fastened with velcro straps.

### 3. Gloves: Better Grip, Less Grazes

Riding gloves aren't just for pro cyclists! They serve two great purposes:
- **Improved Grip:** They help small hands maintain a firm and comfortable grip on the handlebars.
- **Palm Protection:** In a fall, it's natural to put your hands out. Gloves protect their palms from nasty grazes.

### 4. Closed-Toe Shoes: Protect Those Piggies

Thongs and sandals are a no-go for riding. Sturdy, closed-toe shoes like runners or skate shoes protect your child's feet from the pedals, wheels, and any stray rocks. They also provide a much better grip on the ground when they need to steady themselves.

Gearing up is part of the fun and teaches kids responsibility. By making it a non-negotiable part of every ride, you're setting them up for a lifetime of safe and happy adventures. **Ride safe!**
