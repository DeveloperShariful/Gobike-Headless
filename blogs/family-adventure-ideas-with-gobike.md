The best family memories are often made outdoors, away from screens and distractions. Your child's GoBike isn't just for riding around the backyard; it's a passport to countless family adventures. If you're looking for some inspiration for your next weekend outing, we've got you covered.

Here are a few ideas to get the whole family rolling.

### 1. Explore Your Local Bike Path or Park

This is a classic for a reason! Most communities have local parks or dedicated bike paths that are perfect for a family ride.
*   **Pack a Picnic:** Turn a simple ride into a special event by packing a lunch and some snacks. Find a nice grassy spot to relax and refuel.
*   **Nature Scavenger Hunt:** Create a list of things for your kids to find along the way (a red leaf, a smooth stone, a feather). It turns a bike ride into an interactive game.

### 2. A "Race Day" at the BMX Track

Many local councils have public BMX tracks that are perfect for kids to safely test their skills. The small hills and turns (or "berms") are incredibly fun on an electric bike. Itâ€™s a fantastic way for them to build handling skills in a controlled environment. Remember to keep it fun and non-competitive!

### 3. A Beach or Foreshore Cruise

If you live near the coast, a ride along the foreshore is an unbeatable experience. The flat, smooth paths are perfect for young riders, and the ocean view is a bonus for everyone. Just be sure to check that bikes are permitted on the paths you plan to use.

### 4. Create a Backyard Obstacle Course

You don't even need to leave home to have an adventure! Use items from around the house to create a fun and challenging obstacle course in your backyard.
*   **Witch's Hats or Pool Noodles:** Set up a weaving course.
*   **A Small Plank of Wood:** Create a small ramp or bridge to ride over.
*   **Chalk:** Draw a winding track on the driveway for them to follow.

No matter what you choose to do, the most important thing is that you're doing it together. So pump up those tyres, charge those batteries, and get ready to make some memories!
